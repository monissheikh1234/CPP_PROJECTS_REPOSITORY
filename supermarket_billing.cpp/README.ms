## 📁 Project Structure

SupermarketBillingSystem/
├── main.cpp # Main C++ code
├── Inventory.txt # Stores inventory items

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like MinGW or g++).
2. Open a terminal and compile the project:
   Use command:  "g++ main.cpp -o billing.exe"
3. Then run the executable:
    ".\billing.exe"      //on Windows   


If an item is added with the same name **and rate**, its quantity is increased.  
If the **rate differs**, it's treated as a new variant and stored on a new line.
